<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a third year graduate student at Zhejiang University. I obtained my B.Eng degree in Harbin Institute of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. I am dedicated to designing advanced machine learning algorithms for medical image analysis and network neuroscience.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

- For the first time discussed the differences between MDD and HC using both rich club and diverse club metrics and found the complementarity of them in analyzing brain networks.
- Proposed "active index", which defines a group of nodes that tend to be diversely distributed across communities while avoiding being a hub of a community.
